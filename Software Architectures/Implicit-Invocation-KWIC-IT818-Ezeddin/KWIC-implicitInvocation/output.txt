“Go get crystal and meet me at the church.” Harriette said leaving behind Nyla before she could speak.
“Good morning Grumpy mother.” mocks Harriette, as Nyla rolls her eyes while smiling.
“Good morning new mother.” Says Nyla.
“Good morning Nyla, how are you doing this morning?”

“I’m good, got to use that journal you gave me for my birthday.” 
“I’m so sorry sir! I didn’t know I wasn’t supposed to be touching things.”
“Nyla step over to the Priest please!
“Nyla!! We need to go right now!!” Harriette said in a panicked voice.
“NYLA!!”
“Of course, now I’m gonna call someone to come and get this doll then start cleaning up.
“Oh, have you now? You enjoy writing in it?”
“Okay, okay!
“Only if you do the dishes.”
“Oreos and more tea packets.” Nyla shows Harriette the empty Oreo container and tea box.
“Please.”
“She’s getting tired Nyla, it’s been an awful night.
